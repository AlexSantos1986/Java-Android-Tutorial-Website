<li>May work on video game productions, which involves creating challenging computer opponents,
 good graphics and realistic visual behavior</li>
 <li>May be involved in web development, which involves creating user friendly websites which communicate ideas with ease</li>
 <li>May act as a website administrator, which involves verifying HTML validity, enforcing style consistency and making necessary
 updates</li>
