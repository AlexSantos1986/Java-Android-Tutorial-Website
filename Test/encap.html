    <h2>Understand Encapsulation principles</h2>

<p>Encapsulation is a concept of storing data together with methods that operate on that data. Objects are used as the container
for the data and code.I will be showing the principles of encapsulation and how it should be applied by a developer.
Encapsulation allows for data and method hiding. Information hiding makes it possible to expose a public interface while hiding the
implementation details. I will also show how some good basic design principle that should be used with the java language.
 </p>
 <br/>

 <h2> Good design with Encapsulation</h2>

 <p>The fundamental of an object-oriented language is that software is designed by creating discrete objects that interact to make
 up the functionality of the application.Encapsulation is the concept of storing similar data and methods together in discrete classes.
 In many non-object-oriented languages, there is no association between where the data is and where the code is.This can increase
 complexity of maintaining the code, because ofter the variables that the code is using are spread apart over the code base. Bugs in
 the code can be hard to find and resolve due to different remote procedures using the same variable.<br/>

 Encapsulation tries to solve this problems.It let you create code that is easier to read and maintain by allowing you to group related
 variable and methods together in classes.

 <h2>Access Modifiers</h2>

 <p>Access modifiers are keywords that define what can access methods and instance variables.The three access modifier are private,
  protected, and public. These all change the default level of access.The default access level does not use a keyword and is assigned
 to a method or instance variable when neither <b>private, protected or public</b> uses and the area is left blank.Access modifiers are an
 important concept in object-oriented language.They allow the implementation details to be hidden in a class.The developer can choose
 specially what parts of class accessible to other objects.
 </p>

 <p>
 As mentioned, Java uses three access modifiers: <b> private, protected and public.</b>
 The <b>private</b> access modifier is the most restrictive and most commonly used access modifier.Any method or instance variable that is marked
 as <b>private</b> can be accessed only by other methods in the same class. Subclasses cannot access instance variable or methods that are <b>private</b>.
 The following is an example of the <b>private</b> keyword:
</p>

 <div class="blockquote">
 <p><br/>
 private int numberOfStudents;</br><br/>
 private int calculateAverage() {...}<br/><br/>
 </p>

 </div>

<p> The default access level is the second most restrictive.It is often referred to as package-private.This access level allows to its methods
 and instance variables from code that is the same package.The default access level does not have a keyword to indicate it is use.A method or instance
 variable is set to default when an access modifier is omitted.The following is an example of this access level in use:<br/>
 </p>

 <div class="blockquote">
 <p><br/>
 int Student;<br><br/>
 double calculateStudentGrade(){...}<br/><br/>

 </p>

 </div>

 <p>The <b>protected</b> access modifier is the third most restrictive.It is the same as the default access level but adds the ability of subclasses
 outside of the package to access its methods or instance variable.This means the methods that can access this data must either be in the same package
 or be in a subclass of the class that contains the protected data. Remember that a subclass is a class is a class that extends another class.
 Have a look at the example of the use of <b>protected</b> modifier:<br/>
 </p>

 <div class="blockquote">
 <p><br/>
 protected String studentName;<br/><br/>
 protected char getStudentFirstChar(){...}<br/><br/>
 </p>
  </div>

 <p>
The final access modifier is public.This is the least restrictive and second most common access modifier.The public access modifier provides
no restriction to what can access its methods and instance variable regardless of which package it is contained in or which superClass it extends.
A variable named marked as <b>public </b> is accessible to the world.The following is an example of using the <b>public </b>access modifier:</br>
 </p>

  <div class="blockquote">
 <p><br/>
public String StudentAddress;<br/><br/>
public int findZipCode;<br/><br/>
 </p>

 </div>

<h2>Getters and Setters</h2>

<p>
<b>Getters and setters</b> are the basic final concept of hiding information and encapsulation.As was discussed previously,it is good design to make all instance variable
<b>private</b>.This means that subclasses or any external classes have no way to access these variables. Sometimes an external object may need to read one of these
variables to determine its state, or it may have to set the value.To achieve this, a public method is created for the variable, both to get abd set value. These are
called <i>getters</i> and <i>setters</i>.They can be as simple as one line that only sets or returs a value.
The example below is a class that has one instance variable and a setter and getter:
</p>

 <div class="blockquote">
<p><br/>
public class MyClass{ <br/><br/>

private String className; <br/><br/>

public String getClassName(){<br/><br/>
return className;<br/><br/>
}<br/><br/>

public void setClassName(String className){<br/><br/>
 this.className= className;<br/><br/>

 }<br/><br/>

}<br/>

</p>
</div>

<p>
The two methods that are present are getter and setter for the variable className.In this case,the class is giving read and write access to the
variable via the methods. In some cases, a class may give only one or the other. The getter and setter in this demonstration are simple and
only set or return the value.However ,if the class had to perform an action every time the className variable was changed,it could be done from
the setter. For example, each time the className variable is changed,the class must record it.This can be done in the setter.This is the benefit
of keeping instance variable private.It gives control to the class as to how its instance variable are accessed.

</p>

<p>
When developers are working with a class they expect to find getters and setters. They also expect name convention. When creating getter,the
name should start with lowercase get, followed by variable name with no space and the first letter capitalized. When creating a setter, a similar
convention should be followed. A setter should start with the word set, followed by the variable name with the first letter capitalized.
