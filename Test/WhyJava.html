			<h2>Why Java?</h2>

			<h2>Advantages of Java:</h2>
				<p>Learning JAVA is Easy:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Though the statement is subject to raise many contradictions, but this remains a fact. Even if one has no programming background and has never learnt introductory programming languages like C++, learning the concepts of JAVA wouldn’t be a barrier. Without the necessity to use and understand magic characters like Generics Angle Brackets etc., JAVA promotes English syntax and commands instead. Once the initial lessons are caught hold, the rest often becomes easier;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Uses OOPS Concept:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Applications that are developed using the OOPS (Object Oriented Programming) concept of JAVA are more competent as they are extensible, scalable and flexible. It has a rich library of default design patterns and other best practices. Open sources like Spring etc. use the concepts of Object Oriented Programing making it all the more adaptable for application developments on Java;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Platform Independent:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Since the time JAVA has gained popularity, i.e. from 1990s, its Platform Independent nature has made it a highly demanded technology. This feature has made it complement the tagline “Write Once Run Anywhere” in true sense as it has opened doors to many new developments. Till today, this continues to be the reason why many Java applications are built on Windows and run on UNIX;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Java community and Support:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Java’s community support has been bliss to all programmers. Bundles of forums to post queries, Stack overflows and other user groups has always extended support and help on all topics. Giving and taking advice on Java application developments from experts for free has aided in networking one of this biggest and richest community;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Distributed:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Designed to make distributed computing easy with the networking capability that is inherently integrated into it;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Secure:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					The Java language, compiler, interpreter, and runtime environment were each developed with security in mind;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Allocation:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Java has the feature of Stack allocation system. It helps the data to be stored and can be restored easily;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Multithreaded:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					The capability for a program to perform several tasks simultaneously within a program;
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Disadvantages of Java:</h3>

				<p>Performance:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Significantly slower and more memory-consuming than natively compiled languages such as C or C++;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Look and feel:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					The default looks and feel of GUI applications written in Java using the Swing toolkit is very different from native applications;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Single-paradigm language:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					The addition of static imports in Java 5.0 the procedural paradigm is better accommodated than in earlier versions of Java;
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Security Concerns:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Being platform independent, JAVA developments are at a risk of facing security breaches;
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Java 2 Platform Micro Edition</h2>
				<p>J2ME allows developers to use Java and the J2ME wireless toolkit to create applications and programs for wireless and mobile devices.</p>

			<h2>Advantage of J2ME:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
					The J2ME architecture had to be modular and scalable due to the diversity of target devices. To achieve this, J2ME provides a range of virtual machines, each optimized to the different processor types and memory footprints;
					Improved security and consistency of applications across platforms and devices;
					</li>

					<li>
					Superior user interfaces with graphics;
					</li>

					<li>
					The ability to function off-line out of wireless coverage;
					</li>

					<li>
					Peer-to-peer networking;
					</li>

					<li>
					No licensing expenses needed for the SDK, which means that anyone can create an application and market it;
					</li>

				</ul>


			<h2>Disadvantage of J2ME:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Midlet application will never mess up another application on the same device or the device OS itself;
					</li>

					<li>
					Unlike the J2SE, J2ME devices dont have a command prompt;
					</li>

					<li>
					A midlet application invoke in different manner as J2SE because it controls by Application Management Software(AMS);
					</li>

					<li>
					AMS interacts with native operations of a Midlet application and controls its life cycle. It is responsible for starting, processing, stopping and destroy a Midlets application executions;
					</li>

					<li>
					It has memory is very limited, so operating speed is relatively slow;
					</li>

					<li>
					As J2SE application used data persistence, J2ME is done through the Record Management System (RMS), which operates solely on byte arrays. but it provides a security lake;
					</li>

					<li>
					Unlike J2SE, J2ME device does not support full size keyboard specially alphanumeric sequences;
					</li>
